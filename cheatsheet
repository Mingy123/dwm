idk this seems like a good idea
here's my notations for modifiers:
Mod (Windows key) = M
Shift = S
Control = C
Alt = A

Basic functionality
-------------------
M-j/k/Tab shifts your focus between windows
M-h/l moves the separator
M-Enter sets the currently focused window as master
M-q closes a window
M-S-Enter opens a terminal (set terminal in config.def.h)


Tags (Workspaces)
-----------------
M-number puts you into that tag number
M-S-number moves that window into that tag
M-</> moves you left/right

M-A-number swaps the contents of your current tag with that tag
M-C-number adds that tag into your view
M-S-C-number adds the window into the tag (yes multiple tags)


Misc
----
M-p spawns dmenu (app launcher)
M-Space toggles the status bar
M-S-j/k moves a window through the layout
M-t/f/m sets layout to "tiled", "floating" and "monocle"
M-S-</> changes the number of windows in the left area

M-S-Space sets layout to be the previous one
M-o hard locks the window to be opaque
M-S-o toggles inactive transparency
M-S-Backspace makes a floating window tiled
M-r allows you to traverse away from fullscreened windows
M-S-r fake fullscreen, applications are put into fullscreen mode while constrained to their assigned tiling positions


Multi monitors
--------------
A-Tab moves up one monitor
A-S-Tab puts the window into the other monitor
